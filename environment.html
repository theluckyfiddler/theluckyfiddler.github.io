      <h2>Environment</h2>
	
	  <p>If you want your child to succeed at violin, you should set up 
	  an environment which includes </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>listening to music</li> 
	    <li>watching others play</li>
	    <li>practicing regularly</li> 
	  </ul>
	  <p>  Most people need to practice at least five 
      days per week to make progress in any violin method.  
	  Practice should not be long, especially for a beginner, but even a more 
	  advanced student shouldnâ€™t just put in more practice time for it's own sake.  
	  My high school senior practiced 20-30 minutes 
	  a day, and he played very well.  For the very young student, much 
	  of practice might be watching the parent learn to play.  Routine 
	  can help violin practice and listening become something one does, like eating 
	  dinner or story time.</p>

      <p>Listening will make that practice time pay off more.  You can start 
	  listening right away.  Use a music app or search youtube for music. I don't 
	  know if you can still check out music CDs at the library, but find a way to
	  delvelop a daily listening habit.  "Bethoven's Wig" (Bethoven's 5th) or 
	  another Sing Along Symphony might be a good choice for young ones. Bedtime is 
	  good, so is indoor 
	  play time or homework time.  My daughter would listen whenever she 
	  used the computer for work or play.</p>
