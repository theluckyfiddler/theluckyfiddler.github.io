 <h2 id = suzuki>What is the Suzuki Method?</h2> 
 <div class="wrapped">
	  <p>Dr. Suzuki preferred to call his violin teaching method talent 
	  education.  He made the startling discovery that virtually all 
	  children learn to speak their native language, no matter how 
	  difficult.  This led him to design a violin teaching method that 
	  mimicked the language learning process. </p>
      <h3>Ideas behind this method are:</h3> 
	  <ul>
	    <li>Listening and watching others play</li>
		<li>Delaying note reading until tone production is established</li>
		<li>Parental assistance at lessons and at home</li>
		<li>Repetition, repetition, repetition</li>
		<li>Loving encouragement</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>I think this method is especially good for learning instruments 
	  like the violin, on which tone production is difficult.  This method 
	  also works better for the very young than traditional violin methods.
	  </p>
      <p>For more information on the Suzuki Violin Method, go to the 
	  <a href="http://suzukiassociation.org" >Suzuki Association of the Americas</a>
	  website.

    <h2 id = enviroment>Environment</h2>
	<div  class="wrapped">
	  <p>If you want your child to succeed at violin, you should set up 
	  an environment which includes </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>listening to music</li> 
	    <li>watching others play</li>
	    <li>practicing regularly</li> 
	  </ul>
	  <p>  Most people need to practice at least five 
      days per week to make progress in any violin method.  
	  Practice should not be long, especially for a beginner, but even a more 
	  advanced student shouldnâ€™t be made to practice beyond their 
	  endurance level.  My high school senior practiced 20-30 minutes 
	  a day, and he played very well.  For the very young student, much 
	  of practice might be watching the parent learn to play.  Routine 
	  can help violin practice become something one does, like eating 
	  dinner or story time.</p>

      <p>Listening will make that time pay off more.  You can start 
	  listening right away.  Check out some music CDs at the library 
	  and listen to them every day.  Bedtime is good, so is indoor 
	  play time or homework time.  My daughter listened whenever she 
	  uses the computer for work or play.</p>
  </div> <!--end environment -->
   <h2 id = resources>Practice Practice Practice</h2>
   <div  class="wrapped">
     <p>At some point, most parents find it difficult to get their child to practice.  </p>
	   <ul>
         <li>Keep practice time short</a></li>
         <li>Start with something easy, end with something fun  </li>  
         <li>If something is too frustrating, cut your losses</li>
       </ul>

	</div> <!--end practice -->
    <h2>Materials</h2>
    <div id = materials class="wrapped">
	  <p>You will need a Suzuki Violin method volume 1, violin part, book 
	  and CD.  Things like tuners and metronomes are useful to have as 
	  well, but are not necessary at the very beginning.  You will also 
	  need a violin.  </p>
    
	  <p>Most teachers prefer that you see them before you choose an instrument.  
	  Many violin sellers size violins too big.  Nielsen Violin shop, 342-5880 
	  downtown Omaha, has regular hours 
	  and is not too expensive. </p>

	<p>in Des Moines is good if you want to purchase, but I don't think the 
	quality is better if you are renting.  I have had better experiences 
	with these than with the local general music shops.  They are faster 
	at repairs and usually have better quality instruments, but you can 
	get an adequate violin from most of the music shops.  Buying a "violin 
	shaped object" from the internet is quite risky.  Buying a used violin 
	from someone who has taken lessons can be a good deal.  You can also 
	check out sharmusic.com and ymonline.com and doubtless there are others.</p>
